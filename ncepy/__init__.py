   REMARKS: REFERENCE: SHAPIRO, 1970: "SMOOTHING, FILTERING, AND
     BOUNDARY EFFECTS", REV. GEOPHYS. SP. PHYS., 359-387.
     THIS FILTER IS OF THE TYPE
           Z(I) = (1-S)Z(I) + S(Z(I+1)+Z(I-1))/2
     FOR A FILTER WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO DAMP 2DX WAVES COMPLETELY
     BUT LEAVE 4DX AND LONGER WITH LITTLE DAMPING,
     IT SHOULD BE RUN WITH 2 PASSES USING SMTH (OR S) OF 0.5
     AND -0.5.

   Directions on calling the routine.  Call from inside a loop where the
     iterator is the number of smoothing passes.  Smoothing passes can
     set as a function of grid-spacing (how it's handled for the RAP/HRRR)
       Example:

      Number of smoothing passes for each field
